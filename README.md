# Welcome to Creative Writing, a Learning Management System

This is Creative Writing site, where you can sign up and enroll in courses about literature genres and tips for writing!
The **data is created dynamically** through an admin page connected to the firestore database. If you want to test it, ask me for a teachers account!

It is a mobile first page, so please check it out first with your mobile or a mobile screen option in your browser.

You can visit the page [here](https://learning-ms-creative-writing.web.app/) to see the working site. I did more steps of organization, including a Figma design, but I will write a shorter Readme. If you are curious to see or want to talk about it, let me know! :)
